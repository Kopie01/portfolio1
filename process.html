        <h2>My Process</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="displayDescription">
        		When designing an interactive site, there is a process I go through to make sure the site is easily usuable as well as being great to look at. This is an outline of my basic process using my portfolio site as an example.
                <br>
                1. What is the goal of the site? What does success mean?<br>
                First I work out the main aim of the site. Is it to display information to the user? Is it to convince them to sign up to something?
                For my portfolio, the main aim is to display my work in a way that is easy to navigate and also explains a bit about myself. I also need to be contactable.
                <br>
                2. Putting my thoughts on paper<br>
                For this part I look at the content, layout and functionality. I look at the hierachy of information before any visual design. 
                I sketch a site map for navigation through the site. If I need more information about the user I might put out a simple survey to
                the demographic it is designed for.
                <br>
                3. Sketching the framework<br>
                I start sketching some designs for the framework. This includes responsive options. Any site must work well on a mobile, tablet or desktop. This includes any navigational tools to help the user navigate and perform actions. Each section needs to tell a story - have a reason and a final outcome for the user.
                <br>
                4. Mocking up a wireframe<br>
                I will usually use a program such as Sketch or UXPin to make a basic wireframe. This is just the layout of the site with no colours or design added yet.
                <br>
                5. User testing <br>
                I will set some usability standards. This means that if a certain high percentage of user testers pass a navigational test, it is more likely to work in real life. If not, then that particular element will need to be changed. This is also a time to gather feedback about the layout straight from the users themselves. There may be several rounds of user testing before moving on to the next stage. The users testing the site need to be the demographic who it is being designed for. 
                <br>
                6. Deciding on a colour theme and typography. <br>
                By this stage, I will generally have some ideas about a colour theme based on the topic and style of the site, the current branding and the demographic using it. However this can always change through out the process. I will try several different types of fonts to see which one has the best fit.
                <br>
                7. Colour mockup<br>
                I will add colour, typography and usually images to the most succesful design. This will then go through another round of user testing, as colour can affect navigation.
                <br>
                8. Beginning to code<br>
                Once the colour design is successful I begin to create the HTML and CSS to build the site. Javascript may be added later on. The design and colour can still change slightly here. I will usually still do some more user testing as I build as well.
