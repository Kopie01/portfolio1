        		Here are some examples of different magazines I have worked on. The first is a
				cover of Principals Today, a nationwide magazine for New Zealand teachers.
				The second is a page designed for Tearaway magazine, a youth magazine distributed to students throughout the country. 
				The third is a page from Wellington Today, focusing on businesses in Wellington and the surrounding region.
