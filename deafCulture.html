        <h2>Deaf Culture Booklet</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="displayDescription">
        		This is a booklet I designed exploring Deaf Culture.
                This involved alot of research and I also took a basic course in New Zealand
                Sign Language to get more insight in the lives of deaf people. I used illustration to simulate the sign
                movement that is such a large aspect of deaf communication. Many of the illustrations are actual signs used in New Zealand 
                Sign Language. I used bold colours to represent the visual
                part of the culture and I wanted it to appear friendly, fun and approachable to non-deaf people. My use of type 
                for this project often uses the letterforms to express movement, as writing is the visual communication that
                both deaf and non-deaf people can understand, so it is a connecting element.
